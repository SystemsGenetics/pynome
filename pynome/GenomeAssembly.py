           - genus: The genus of the assembly.
           - taxonomy_id: The numerical taxonomy identifier.
           - intraspecific_name: The intra-specific name of a given entry.
        
           - fasta_uri: The fa.gz url as a String.
           - fasta_size: The remote size of the fa.gz file as an Integer.

           - local_path: The local path of this genome as a String.
           - base_filename: The filename base for this genome item entry.

        An instance of this class should be created whenever a genome entry
        needs to be created or modified.
